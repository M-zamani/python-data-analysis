# Customer Churn Analysis — Python EDA + Business Insights

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using a telecom-style dataset to identify key drivers of churn and provide actionable business recommendations.

**Goal:** Understand why customers leave and suggest retention strategies.  
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook, Power BI / Tableau

---

## Dataset

Recommended dataset (Kaggle):
**Telco Customer Churn**
https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Download `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` and place it in the project folder as:

```
data/churn.csv
```

## Project Steps

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning (missing values, types, encoding)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Churn driver analysis
5. Business insights and recommendations

---

## Key Questions Answered

- Which customer segments churn the most?
- Does contract type affect churn?
- How does tenure relate to churn?
- Which services increase churn risk?
- Which payment methods are riskier?

---

## Outputs

- Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- Visualizations for churn trends
- Clean dataset ready for Power BI / Tableau dashboard

---

## Dashboard Ideas (Power BI / Tableau)

KPIs:
- Churn Rate (%)
- Avg Tenure (Churned vs Active)
- Monthly Charges by Churn

Charts:
- Churn by Contract Type
- Churn by Internet Service
- Tenure Distribution by Churn
- Payment Method vs Churn

---

## Business Recommendations (Example)

- Offer discounts to month-to-month customers after 3 months
- Promote annual contracts to high-risk segments
- Improve service quality for fiber internet customers
- Incentivize auto-payment methods

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard — Customer Churn Analysis

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to analyze churn behavior across customer segments and identify high-risk groups.

### 🎯 Key KPIs
- Total Customers  
- Churned Customers  
- Churn Rate (%)  
- Average Customer Tenure  

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Customers on month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates.  
- Fiber optic internet users have significantly higher churn.  
- Electronic check payment method is associated with the highest churn.  
- Customers in the first 6–12 months have the highest churn risk.

### 💡 Business Recommendations
- Launch early retention programs for new customers.  
- Promote long-term contract incentives.  
- Improve fiber service reliability and support.  
- Encourage auto-payment adoption.

### 📁 Deliverables
- Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)  
- Python EDA Notebook
